## Setup
1. Fork this task.

## Task
1. Create a function called `cube` that takes an argument called `number`.

2. Make that function return the cube of that number (the number to the power of 3).

3. Create a second function called `by_three` that takes an argument called `number`.

4. If that number is divisible by 3, `by_three` should call `cube(number)` and return its result. 

5. Otherwise, `by_three` should return `False`.
